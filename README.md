# RTLProjects
This repo contains any current or previous RTL projects I am working on outside of school.
In addition it includes some tutorial code I created for digital design.

Digital Design Projects:
  - Video 1: Intro to DD, Seq vs. conc
  - Video 2: Creating a combinational digital circuit, the blackbox approach
  - Video 3: Intro to testbenchs
  - Video 4: Creating a sequintial circuit
  - Video 5: Creating a structural architecture

Current Projects:
  - I want to create a 2-input decoder using RTL code.
  - My reasoning for this project is I want to possibly apply this decoder to DC motor encoders for IEEE Hardware Team
  - I also see the benefit to this being an easy enough project to be able to orighinally create in VHDL, the RTL language I know, and change it into verilog, a language I am not familiar with.
  - I also plan on creating a testbench in SystemVerilog.
