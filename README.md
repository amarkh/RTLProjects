# RTLProjects
This repo contains any current or previous RTL projects I am working on outside of school.

Current Projects:
  - I want to create a 2-input decoder using RTL code.
  - My reasoning for this project is I want to possibly apply this decoder to DC motor encoders for IEEE Hardware Team
  - I also see the benefit to this being an easy enough project to be able to orighinally create in VHDL, the RTL language I know, and change it into verilog, a language I am not familiar with.
  - I also plan on creating a testbench in SystemVerilog.
